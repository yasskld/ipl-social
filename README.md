## Project description

This project implements an email validation function written in TypeScript.
The development follows a Test Driven Development (TDD) approach using Jest.
A Continuous Integration pipeline is configured with GitHub Actions to
automatically run the tests on each push and on pull requests to the main branch.

The email validation rules are implemented manually, without using any
pre-built email validation libraries.

## Run the tests

```bash
npm test
```
